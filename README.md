This repo contains a set of contracts to facilitate on-chain distribution of vesting earnings on an aggregated schedule. This allows for multiple deposits to be made to the same contract on a recurring basis with custom vesting parameters.

## Testing and Development
#### Setup
```sh
git clone git@github.com:maple-labs/revenue-distribution-token.git
cd revenue-distribution-token
forge update
```
#### Running Tests
- To run all tests: `make test` (runs `./test.sh`)
- To run a specific test function: `./test.sh -t <test_name>` (e.g., `./test.sh -t test_deposit`)
- To run tests with a specified number of fuzz runs: `./test.sh -r <runs>` (e.g., `./test.sh -t test_deposit -r 10000`)
